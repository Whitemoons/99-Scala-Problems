# 99 Scala Problems

This is a set of 99 Scala problems of various levels of difficulty.

This repository is a set of problems to prepare for the final exam of Programming Principle in SNU's 2024-2 term.

All solutions are written by Whitemoons. A few problems have been modified to fit our courses.

The following conditions apply to all problems.

## Principles of Programming.

## WARNING:
  Please read the restrictions below carefully.
  If you do not follow these, **your submission will not be graded.**
  
  - Do not use the keyword `var`. Use `val` and `def` instead.
  - Do not use any library functions or data structures like `List`,
    `Array`, `Range` (`1 to n`, `1 until n` ...), `fold`, `map`, `reduce` or
    etc.
  - If you want to use a data structure, create new one instead of using the
    library ones.
  - You can only use tuples, `scala.annotation.tailrec`, and
    `scala.util.control.TailCalls._` from the library.
  - Do not use any looping syntax of Scala (`for`, `while`, `do-while`,
    `yield`, ...)
  
  Again, your score will be zero if you do not follow these rules.
  
  Note that these rules will be gradually relaxed through the next
  assignments.
  
  We do not require tail-recursion explicitly for this assignment.
